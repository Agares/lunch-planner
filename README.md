If you notice any issues (code that is not obvious is an issue too!), please create a pull request or an issue.
Before creating an issue check if there's already a todo in the code or an item on the Trello board (https://trello.com/b/3d2WPTQN/lunch).
If you want to contribute, please contact me before that to coordinate.
